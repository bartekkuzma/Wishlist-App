## About App

The WISHLIST APP is an application (now available only in terminal), developed for solving one of the biggest problem during ocassions like Christmas, when you, your family and friends are going to buy some gifts for each other.  
The main problem is: „Who wants what?” – For a buyer, and „Ehh I don’t know how to say him/her what is my dream, what a shame, I’ll get socks, like one year ago…” – for a beneficiary. The WISHLIST APP is also ideal choice when you have got many groups in your society, and you want to target specific wishlist to specific group of potential buyers.   
In WISHLIST APP, it is forbidden to choose one wish from wishlist several times, so the situation, where one person get the same wish two times is impossible! The WISHLIST APP is also very discreet, you can still make a surprise for your beneficiary, but only a good surprise with a gift that he/she really want! In WISHLIST APP, other users, belonging to the same group, could see only what wishes are choosen, and the beneficiary could not even see which wishes form his/her wishlist is already choosen, so he/she know what could expect (because of he/she wrote a wishlist), but doesn’t know what he/she will get (of course if more than one wish is included in wishlist).
